# hoboitems

This script is to handle the load up for getting through the dungeon to hobopolis in the least amount of turns. It will:

-Confirm you have all the items you need to past the test<br>
-Equip items needed and maximize your non-combat with gear and no meat cost skills<br>
-All you to set a purchase price of non-combat if you want to buy more<br>
-Set a combat script to runaway/Cleesh enemies<br>


Will be experimental: <br>
-Spend turns and check the number of grates opened before each adventure and once X is open stop checking and just run it.
